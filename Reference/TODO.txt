-Class/race System
--Decide what races to have
---Decide Stat caps and race traits for races

--Decide What classes to have///(atm we got warrior, novice, archer and crafter done)

----Decide what things to be locked for diffrent classes (ex Archer can only wear leather-chain mail mages only leather-studeed leather)

--Script races and classes
--Write class/race lore and posting it on the website

--Design race towns? :-) right .mul files.

-Make a website, " under construction" ? to fuel intressed players

-Script Travel Mages

-- Important!! Fighting, the right swing speed for monsters and players! = str-dex 

--Disable mounted combat and disable mounting in dungeons/housed/indoors

-- remove text for hits , emersive



- easier to gain combats skills( combats skills from 50 should be ok to go farming for easier monsters) 
- harder to gain craft skills. profits for crafters that keep going and keep the economy in check.

*idea balance for mages , novice 60 tac mage 80 tac and arch mage 95 ? because this will affect your spellcasting % chance for fizzle.
